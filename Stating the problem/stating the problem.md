# Stating the problem

## Description

GCSE physics students in DGSB require knowledge of circuits as part of their
course, but unfortunately the physical equipment to learn many of these circuits
is expensive and limited in the school, is easily broken, and home learning
is not possible as equipment cannot be taken outside of school. Many students
simply learn about these circuits from an image from a textbook.

## Features

My program is a circuit simulator program that demonstrates
simple electrical circuits to determine if they will work, and allows students
to check if they function correctly.

This would benefit for the physics
department as the equipment their equipment is fairly old, and sometimes broken,
and so a simple program would be a good way to show current split, resistance
over distance, voltages, etc. Their equipment is also limited, so is often
shared between classes, with not enough for each student.

This program would allow students to experiment with circuits at home as well,
as usually students cannot take home equipment because there is a limited amount,
and they are also quite delicate.

## Justification for computational solution

The physics calculations are an ideal fit for a computational solution.
This is because the amount of maths required is significant, so would be time-consuming for
anybody to do to just demonstrate the physics.
