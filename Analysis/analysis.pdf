<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>GCSE physics students in DGSB require knowledge of circuits as part of their course, but unfortunately the physical equipment to teach many of these circuits is expensive, limited in the school, is easily broken, and home learning is not possible as equipment cannot be taken outside of school. Most students simply learn about these circuits from an image in a textbook.</p>
<h2 id="justification-for-computational-solution">Justification for computational solution</h2>
<p>The physics calculations are an ideal fit for a computational solution. This is because the amount of maths required is significant, so would be time-consuming for anybody to do to just demonstrate the physics.</p>
<p>These calculations are not required by GCSE level physics, so would be difficult to be shown manually by a teacher who does not need to know or explain the equations. Showing the values of current and voltage at any point is sufficient at GCSE level.</p>
<p>There will be a high level of abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism, as this is needed for a hierarchy of components, with one base component extending off into a dozen other components.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-like">What I Like:</h3>
<ul>
<li>GUI program, not CLI.</li>
<li>Drag &amp; drop of components onto a canvas.</li>
<li>Can import/export circuits.</li>
<li>Can simulate circuits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-i-dislike">What I Dislike:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Massively complicated - menus inside menus with buried functionality.</li>
<li>Unsuitable for students - many components irrelevant to the GCSE.</li>

<h3 id="what-i-like-1">What I Like:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Has less menus than QUCS, is easier to navigate.</li>
<li>Can import/export circuits.</li>
<li>Can simulate circuits.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-i-dislike-1">What I Dislike:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is a web app, so is not native and uses up a lot of computing power.</li>
<li>It is made for companies, not students.</li>
<li>Too many components irrelevant to the GCSE.</li>

<h3 id="what-i-like-2">What I Like:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Much better for teaching students</li>
<li>Shows all the calculations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-i-dislike-2">What I Dislike:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some required calculations are not needed for the GCSE, so the students would need to learn lots of irrelevant equations.</li>
<li>Takes up a large amount of time.</li>
<li>Can have errors that will be taken forward.</li>
