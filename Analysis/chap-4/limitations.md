# Limitations of the solution

My solution should fit the brief of being able to parse and solve
circuits that are inputted by users, although some things will not be
included in the solution:

- My solution will not be entirely accurate, as the calculations I will
	be using are good, but not exact, as many of them are purely
	theoretical, so my solution will be as good as any paper method.

- Not many components will be included, as adding new circuits is a slow
	process, and the simulator is designed to be simple enough for
	a GCSE student to understand every part.
