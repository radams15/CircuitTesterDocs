# Research Questions


## For physics teachers:

 1. Are you currently satisfied with the electronics
	equipment in school? Why?

 2. Would you feel comfortable teaching students electronics
	with a computer program?

 3. Do you feel it would be beneficial to be able to send
	students assignments to make circuits at home on this program?

 4. Would you agree that students would understand theories better
	if they were given an example of the theories working? E.g.
	seeing the current splitting between a parallel circuit.

 5. Do you feel that a program that can be used on personal devices
	would be a helpful aid for home learning?

 6. Have you ever used any kind of circuit planning tools before?
	If so, what was your opinion on it, and what would you like
	to see added?

 7. Have you got anything else to add?

 4. What are the qualities of real circuits that you would
	like to be reflected in a piece of software?
