# Research Questions


## For physics teachers:

 1. Are you currently satisfied with the electronics
	equipment in school? Why/why not?

 2. Do you feel comfortable teaching students electronics
	with a computer program? If not why?

 3. Do you feel it would be beneficial to be able to send
	students assignments to make circuits at home on this program?

 4. Would you agree that students would understand theories better
	if they were given an example of the theories working? E.g.
	seeing the current splitting between a parallel circuit.

 5. Do you feel that a program that can be used on personal devices
	would be a helpful aid for home learning?

 6. Have you ever used any kind of circuit planning/testing tools before?
	If so, what was your opinion on it, and what would you like
	to see added?

 7. Please add anything else you would like to say here.

## Mr Collins (physics teacher)

 1. **Are you currently satisfied with the electronics
	equipment in school? Why/why not?**

	*Not really, although I must confess I am no expert on electronics.*

 2. **Do you feel comfortable teaching students electronics
	with a computer program? If not why?**

	*I would not know where to start so no not really.*

 3. **Do you feel it would be beneficial to be able to send
	students assignments to make circuits at home on this program?**

	*Yes I do.*

 4. **Would you agree that students would understand theories better
	if they were given an example of the theories working? E.g.
	seeing the current splitting between a parallel circuit.**

	*Definitely, the beauty of such programs is that they demonstrate the
laws of physics that you want students to see every time rather than failing
because in reality that's what science experiments do so regularly. Then students get
disinterested and bored and fail to learn.*

 5. **Do you feel that a program that can be used on personal devices
	would be a helpful aid for home learning?**

	*yes, pretty much everyone has a smart phone now so why not use them educationally more often*

 6. **Have you ever used any kind of circuit planning/testing tools before?
	If so, what was your opinion on it, and what would you like
	to see added?**

	*I am a fan of "phet." [https://phet.colorado.edu](https://phet.colorado.edu) This works quite well -
it would be good to add more A level Physics simulations to it.*

 7. **Please add anything else you would like to say here.**

	*Thank you for involving me.*


## Analysis of Mr Collins:

Mr Collins thought that the program would be very beneficial, especially
on personal devices. He believes that demonstrating theories is extremely
helpful for learning, and therefore I think that my program will
help education.

He suggested that I look at PHET circuit construction kit
[https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/circuit-construction-kit-dc/latest/circuit-construction-kit-dc_en.html](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/circuit-construction-kit-dc/latest/circuit-construction-kit-dc_en.html),
and so I have added to my existing solutions page. He suggests that it would be improved by adding A-Level
components and examples.

## My Peers (A-Level physics student)

 1. **Are you currently satisfied with the electronics
	equipment in school? Why/why not?**

	*Not especially. We very rarely get to use any electrical equipment. Often we
are just shown demonstrations, or if not, a textbook image.*

 2. **Do you think that being able to experiment
	with circuits at home would aid in your learning?**

	*Yes I think it would. It would be helpful to have some sort of
revision bank of circuits.*

 3. **Would you say that you understand theories better
	if you were given an example of the theories working?**

	*Definitely, it would help me to see them in action, and understand the equations more fully.*

 4. **What are the qualities of real circuits that you would
	like to be reflected in a piece of software?**

	*I would like to see fuses that can blow, showing their maximum current and the thickness
of the wire inside them.*

 5. **Have you ever used any kind of circuit planning tools before?
	If so, what was your opinion on it, and what would you like
	to see added?**

	*No, never*

 6. **Have you got anything else to add?**

	*No*


## Analysis of my peers:

My peers thought that the school equipment is lacking in some areas, and believed that the
textbooks are not as helpful as a demonstration would be, even with a program.

They had not ever used a circuit planning program, but thought that it would be
beneficial to their learning.

They decided that it would be helpful to learn at home using my program, and thought that
it would be nice to have a bank of revision materials, including circuits for my program that they can
load up and look at.
