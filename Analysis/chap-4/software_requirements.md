# Requirements

## General requirements:

- A screen - user needs to be able to see the program

- A keyboard & mouse - user needs these to navigate the program.
	A touchscreen is inadequate as the menu bar will be fairly small.

- Operating systems listed below with approximately 4GB RAM.
 - This is because these systems are fairly up to date, and will be able
	to run compiled versions of my program.
 - The RAM requirement is a common quantity of RAM. The program will
	probably run on less, but 4GB is a safe amount.

- No additional software dependencies are required as my output will
	be a self-contained executable.

## Mac OSX:

- Mac OSX 10.10 or greater (x64).
- 4 GB RAM

## Windows:

- Windows 7 or greater (x64).
- 4 GB RAM

## Linux:
