# Requirements

## General requirements:

- A screen - user needs to be able to see the program.

- A keyboard & mouse - user needs these to navigate the program.
	A touchscreen is inadequate as the menu bar will be fairly small.

- Operating systems listed below with approximately 4GB RAM.
 - This is because these systems are fairly up to date, and will be able
	to run compiled versions of my program.
 - The RAM requirement is a common quantity of RAM. The program will
	probably run on less, but 3GB is a safe amount.
 - Similarly, the 64-bit requirement is common for computers. The program
	would probably run on any x86 or ARM machine, but this will not
	be tested as they are uncommon.

- No additional software dependencies are required as my output will
	be a self-contained executable, with the required libraries
	bundled with the program.

## Mac OSX:

- Mac OSX 10.10 or greater (64 bit).
- 3 GB RAM

## Windows:

- Windows 7 or greater (64 bit).
- 3 GB RAM

## Linux:

- RHEL 7 or equivalent (64 bit).
- 3 GB RAM
