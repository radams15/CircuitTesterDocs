# Approaches

There are a few approaches I can take with the backend circuit execution
program:

## [Node voltage method](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering/ee-circuit-analysis-topic/ee-dc-circuit-analysis/a/ee-node-voltage-method)

This method is


## [Loop current method](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering/ee-circuit-analysis-topic/ee-dc-circuit-analysis/a/ee-loop-current-method)



## [Modified modal analysis](https://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/mna/MNA2.html)

This is a method that is more suited for computers, as the algorithm is very clear.
