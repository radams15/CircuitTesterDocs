# Success Criteria

I will try to succeed in all of these success
criteria.

- [ ] Should have an interface that is easy to navigate.
	A questionnaire will ask the student how easy the program
	is to navigate on a scale of 1-10. A result of over 7 would
	be successful. This is asked as the existing solutions
	are hard to navigate, and complicated for a student.

- [ ] Should be able to be displayed on a large screen.
	The program will be displayed with a projector,
	and if all parts of the program can be seen from
	the back of a regular classroom, I will have succeeded.

- [ ] Should be able to run on low-end machines without noticable
	lag. To test this I will run the program in a virtual machine
	with 1 core and 2GB of RAM, running Windows 7. If the program can
	load within 5 seconds, and does not noticably stutter, then I will
	have succeeded.

- [ ] Should be able to import/export circuits. This will be
	successful if a circuit can be saved on one machine,
	sent to another machine via email, then imported on
	the second machine successfully.
