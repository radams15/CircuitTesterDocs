# Existing Solutions To My Problem


## [Qucs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qucs)

![qucs](images/qucs.png)

### What I Like:

 - GUI program, not CLI.

 - Drag & drop of components onto a canvas.

 - Can import/export circuits.

 - Can simulate circuits.

 - Uses SPICE circuit format.

## What I Dislike:

 - Massively complicated - menus inside menus with
	buried functionality.

 - Unsuitable for students - many components
	irrelevant to the GCSE.

 - Dated, rarely updated (last updated 2017), uses old tools (QT4)


QUCS is a nice GUI program that can simulate circuits, although
it is very difficult to use for a student, as there are many more
components than any student could ever want.

## [Partsim](https://www.partsim.com/simulator)

![partsim](images/partsim.png)

### What I Like:

 - Has less menus than QUCS, is easier to navigate.

 - Can import/export circuits.

 - Can simulate circuits.

### What I Dislike:

 - It is a web app, so is not native and uses up a lot of
	computing power.

 - It is made for companies, not students.

 - Too many components irrelevant to the GCSE.


Partsim is a webapp which is meant to design and simulate circuits
for businesses, so it obviously not meant for students to use, 
especially GCSE ones.

Webapps generally use a lot more processing power than desktop apps,
so this makes the program less accessible to students who may have
fewer computing resources.

## [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/editor/)


![CircuitLab](images/circuitlab.png){ width=250px }

### What I Like:

 - Has less menus than QUCS, but more than Partsim

 - Nice layout (scrollable sidebar)

### What I Dislike:

 - It is a web app like Partsim, so is not native and uses up a lot of
	computing power.

 - It is made for companies, not students.

 - Too many components irrelevant to the GCSE.

 - Limited version, the full version is Â£24/person/year

 - Definitely more of a commercial product.

 - Simulation button is very confusing, has way too many options.

## [Micro-Cap](http://www.spectrum-soft.com/download/download.shtm)


![microcap](images/microcap.png)

### What I Like:

 - Desktop GUI, not a webapp.

 - Uses SPICE circuit format.

### What I Dislike:

 - Very old, boasts compatability with windows 98

 - Very difficult to use, arguably more difficult than QUCS


This is a very old circuit simulator than until recently cost
money to purchase on a CD. Now thought, it is free to use without
a license key, so is seeing more adoption, although it is still
not as widely used.

## Physical Circuits

![physical](images/physical.jpg)


### What I Like:

 - The only true way to see the effects of circuits.

 - Everything is physically correct.

### What I Dislike:

 - Takes a long time to set up

 - Experiment short

 - May not be worth the time to demonstrate a simple circuit,
	teachers will generally use the paper method instead
	as textbooks will show diagrams of circuits.


Of course physical circuits are the only true way to show the
effect of the real world on circuits, better than any calculations
done by humans or computers.

The downside though is that it takes too long to set up these
experiments, when the experiment itself could take just 5 minutes,
and the setup could take half an hour. Many teachers will just not
want to setup these experiments as it is just too much work for
such a little reward.


\newpage


## Paper-based

![paper](images/paper.jpg)

### What I Like:

 - Much better for teaching students

 - Shows all the calculations.

### What I Dislike:

 - Some required calculations are not needed for the
	GCSE, so the students would need to learn lots
	of irrelevant equations.

 - Takes a long time to work out larger circuits.

 - Can have errors that will be taken forward.


Paper based calculations are an excellent way to learn,
but students at GCSE level only need to learn a few equations,
which are not enough to simulate entire circuits.

Students would need to learn difficult, advanced physics
to calculate what my program will do, as this would be a waste
of time for teachers and students, just to demonstrate a simple
physical idea.

# Research Questions


## For physics teachers:

 1. Are you currently satisfied with the electronics
	equipment in school?

 2. Would you feel comfortable teaching students electronics
	with a computer program?

 3. Do you feel it would be beneficial to be able to send
	students assignments to make circuits at home on this program?

 4. Would you agree that students would understand theories better
	if they were given an example of the theories working? E.g.
	seeing the current splitting between a parallel circuit.

 5. Do you feel that a program that can be used on personal devices
	would be a helpful aid for home learning?

## For physics students:

 1. Are you currently satisfied with the electronics
	equipment in school?

 2. Do you think that being able to experiment
	with cicuits at home would aid in your learning?

 3. Would you say that you understand theories better
	if they were given an example of the theories working?
