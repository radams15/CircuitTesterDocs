| Requirements                                    | Explanation                                                                             |
+=================================================+=========================================================================================+
| Input circuits from textbook                    | The teacher will be able to show examples of circuits endorsed by the exam board.       |
|                                                 |                                                                                         |
|                                                 | Some of these will be manually input by me to be program default examples, others       |
|                                                 | will need to be manually added by the user.                                             |
+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Show information about the circuit              | To show where current is diverted inside circuits, over distances, etc.                 |
| at any point.                                   |                                                                                         |
|                                                 | This will be achieved by using ammeter/volt meter components that are attached          |
|                                                 | in series/parallel respectively.                                                        |
+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Change component settings during operation.     | To show how different variables affect circuit operation, to aid in learning.           |
|                                                 |                                                                                         |
|                                                 | This will use a settings menu that is activated when a component is double clicked.     |
+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Work without noticeable lag on low-end hardware | Students and teachers may not have high-end hardware, so this program will              |
|                                                 | need to run reasonably well on older and slower computers.                              |
|                                                 |                                                                                         |
|                                                 | The program should aim to run well on hardware that is around 10 years old.             |
+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Can import/export circuit designs.              | Teachers and students need to be able to save/load their existing circuits so           |
|                                                 | that they do not need to make them each time, which could be time consuming for a short |
|                                                 | demonstration.                                                                          |
|                                                 |                                                                                         |
|                                                 | Students can be sent circuits by their teachers over email, and would be able           |
|                                                 | to save these for revision purposes.                                                    |
