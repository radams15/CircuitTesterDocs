# Existing Solutions To The Problem


## [Qucs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qucs)

![Qucs](images/qucs.png)

### What I Like:

- GUI program, not CLI.

- Drag & drop of components onto a canvas.

- Can import/export circuits.

- Can simulate circuits.

- Uses SPICE circuit format.

### What I Dislike:

- Massively complicated - menus inside menus with
	buried functionality.

- Unsuitable for students - many components
	irrelevant to the GCSE.

- Dated, rarely updated (last updated 2017), uses old tools (QT4)

### What I Will Take Forward:

- GUI program.

- Drag & drop components.

- Circuit import/export.

- Circuit simulation ability.

### Comments:

QUCS is a nice GUI program that can simulate circuits, although
it is very difficult to use for a student, as there are many more
components than any student could ever want.

## [Partsim](https://www.partsim.com/simulator)

![PartSim](images/partsim.png)

### What I Like:

- Has less menus than QUCS, is easier to navigate.

- Can import/export circuits.

- Can simulate circuits.

### What I Dislike:

- It is a web app, so is not native and uses up a lot of
	computing power.

- It is made for companies, not students.

- Too many components irrelevant to the GCSE.

### What I Will Take Forward:

- Fewer menu options.

- Circuit import/export.

- Circuit simulation ability.

### Comments:

Partsim is a webapp which is meant to design and simulate circuits
for businesses, so it obviously not meant for students to use, 
especially GCSE ones.

Webapps generally use a lot more processing power than desktop apps,
so this makes the program less accessible to students who may have
fewer computing resources.

## [CircuitLab](https://www.circuitlab.com/editor/)


![CircuitLab](images/circuitlab.png){ width=250px }

### What I Like:

- Has less menus than QUCS, but more than Partsim.

- Nice layout (scrollable sidebar).

### What I Dislike:

- It is a web app like Partsim, so is not native and uses up a lot of
	computing power.

- It is made for companies, not students.

- Too many components irrelevant to the GCSE.

- Limited version, the full version is Â£24/person/year.

- Definitely more of a commercial product.

- Simulation button is very confusing, has way too many options.


### What I Will Take Forward:

- Free software.

- Scrollable sidebar of components.

### Comments:

This is another web based circuit designer, which is a lot easier to use than Partsim.
Once again though, it has far too many components for the average GCSE level student, which
will only confuse them.

Again this is designed for companies, and even limits the use of the free version,
selling a premium version for a yearly subscription.

## [Micro-Cap](http://www.spectrum-soft.com/download/download.shtm)

### What I Like:

- Desktop GUI, not a webapp.

- Uses SPICE circuit format.

### What I Dislike:

- Very old, boasts compatability with windows 98

- Very difficult to use, arguably more difficult than QUCS

### What I Will Take Forward:

- GUI program

### Comments:

This is a very old circuit simulator than until recently cost
money to purchase on a CD. Now thought, it is free to use without
a license key, so is seeing more adoption, although it is still
not as widely used.

## Physical Circuits

![Physical Method](images/physical.jpg)


### What I Like:

- The only true way to see the effects of circuits.

- Everything is physically correct.

### What I Dislike:

- Takes a long time to set up

- Experiment short

- May not be worth the time to demonstrate a simple circuit,
	teachers will generally use the paper method instead
	as textbooks will show diagrams of circuits.

### Comments:

Of course physical circuits are the only true way to show the
effect of the real world on circuits, better than any calculations
done by humans or computers.

The downside though is that it takes too long to set up these
experiments, when the experiment itself could take just 5 minutes,
and the setup could take half an hour. Many teachers will just not
want to setup these experiments as it is just too much work for
such a little reward.



\newpage



## Paper-based

![Paper Method](images/paper.jpg)

### What I Like:

- Much better for teaching students

- Shows all the calculations.

### What I Dislike:

- Some required calculations are not needed for the
	GCSE, so the students would need to learn lots
	of irrelevant equations.

- Takes a long time to work out larger circuits.

- Can have errors that will be taken forward.

### What I Will Take Forward:

- Uses most of the same physics calculations as the ones in the course.

### Comments:

Paper based calculations are an excellent way to learn,
but students at GCSE level only need to learn a few equations,
which are not enough to simulate entire circuits.

Students would need to learn difficult, advanced physics
to calculate what my program will do, as this would be a waste
of time for teachers and students, just to demonstrate a simple
physical idea.

## [PHET Circuit Construction Kit](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/circuit-construction-kit-dc/latest/circuit-construction-kit-dc_en.html)

![PHET](images/PHET.png)

### What I Like:

- Very easy and suited to GCSE and lower level students.

- Has fewer components, so easier for teachers and students to understand.


### What I Dislike:

- No save/load facility.

- Has irrelevant components such as "dog", "hand", "dollar bill" that have
	no function in learning.

- Fairly slow to load as it is a web app.

### What I Will Take Forward:

- Easy interface that scales well.

- Simple drag and drop interface.

- Animated components, e.g. bulb lights up when on.

- Can change the settings of components by clicking on them
	e.g can change battery voltage with a slider.


### Comments:

This was suggested by Mr Collins in the research questions section.

It is a very easy to understand system, which is obviously designed for students, but
possibly younger students than I am targeting.

It seems to be focused more on simplicity than on learning though, so I will remove the
unnecessary components like dogs and money, although an insulator could be an interesting
addition to my simulator at some point.
