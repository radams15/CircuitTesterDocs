# Existing Solutions


## [Qucs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qucs)

![qucs](images/qucs.png)

### What I Like:

 - GUI program, not CLI.

 - Drag & drop of components onto a canvas.

 - Can import/export circuits.

 - Can simulate circuits.

## What I Dislike:

 - Massively complicated - menus inside menus with
	buried functionality.

 - Unsuitable for students - many components
	irrelevant to the GCSE.






## [Partsim](https://www.partsim.com/simulator)

![partsim](images/partsim.png)

### What I Like:

 - Has less menus than QUCS, is easier to navigate.

 - Can import/export circuits.

 - Can simulate circuits.

### What I Dislike:

 - It is a web app, so is not native and uses up a lot of
	computing power.

 - It is made for companies, not students.

 - Too many components irrelevant to the GCSE.







## Paper-based

![paper](images/paper.jpg)

### What I Like:

 - Much better for teaching students

 - Shows all the calculations.

### What I Dislike:

 - Some required calculations are not needed for the
	GCSE, so the students would need to learn lots
	of irrelevant equations.

 - Takes a long time to work out larger circuits.

 - Can have errors that will be taken forward.

# Research Questions


## For physics teachers:

 1. Are you currently satisfied with the electronics
	equipment in school?

 2. Would you feel comfortable teaching students electronics
	with a computer program?

 3. Do you feel it would be beneficial to be able to send
	students assignments to make circuits at home on this program?

 4. Would you agree that students would understand theories better
	if they were given an example of the theories working? E.g.
	seeing the current splitting between a parallel circuit.

 5. Do you feel that a program that can be used on personal devices
	would be a helpful aid for home learning?

## For physics students:

 1. Are you currently satisfied with the electronics
	equipment in school?

 2. Do you think that being able to experiment
	with cicuits at home would aid in your learning?

 3. Would you say that you understand theories better
	if they were given an example of the theories working?
