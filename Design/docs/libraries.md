# Libraries and Imports

### [QT Framework](https://www.qt.io/)

I will use the QT framework for the GUI design, as
this is one of the best libraries for cross-platform GUI
programs.

It has built in components for the canvas that I will be using
for my [MainWindow](#main-window-in-use).


### [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)

Eigen is a c++ library that is used to solve complex mathematical formulae.

For my project specifically, I will be using the matrix classes, including
the ability to solve matrices.

### [C++ Standard Library](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/)

The c++ standard library is still an imported library, as extra algorithms
such as sorting, filtering, and parsing functions are used, as well as the extra
classes of vector (a list), map (a dictionary), queue, and string.

Although QT includes alternative libraries that perform the same tasks as the
standard library, I will always use the c++ libraries before the QT ones.
