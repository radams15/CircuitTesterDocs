# Sources

For this design I have utilised many sources to work out how to achieve my solution.




### Drifter1's Tutorials

These tutorials were essential to helping me to understand how to simulate circuits using modified nodal analysis.

### Khan Academy

These two guides were helpful to aid my learning about circuit simulation, and why
these two methods are done. Even though I didn't use the loop current method, it was still
helpful to understand.
