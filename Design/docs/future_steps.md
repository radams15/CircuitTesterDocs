# Future Steps

In the future if possible, I would add the following extra features:

- Ability to include zero-resistance resistors and zero-voltage batteries without this breaking the program.
- Having a save screen that reminds the user if they will overwrite an existing save file with the same name.
- Have a load screen with images of the saved circuits and allow them to select the one they want rather than
    remembering the save name (similar to the program "The Powder Toy" below).
- Create an algorithm so that the wires do not cross over each other.
- Add more components such as bulbs and buzzers.
- Make the switch change its icon when it is on/off.
