# Conclusion

Overall, I would say my program has somewhat reached the aims of my task, as I have passed all of my success criteria and tests. The program however is difficult to use, but I cannot think of an easier layout so the tutorial helps to teach people how to use my program correctly.

With more time I could improve the project slightly, but for the time I had this program is acceptable for the needs of the stakeholders.
