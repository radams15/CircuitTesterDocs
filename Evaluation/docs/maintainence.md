# Maintainence

My program is very portable, being able to run on the following systems:

- MacOS (>= 10.8)
- Linux (>= Ubuntu 14.04)
- Windows (>= XP)

When there is a new QT release the programs could be updated, although this is not required, only advised.

For example the Windows XP build runs on QT 5.6 which has not been supported since March 2019, but the builds for Windows 7+, MacOs 10.11+ and Ubuntu 16.04+ are still supported.

The program does not work very well on small screens (\<\10") or touchscreens because of the menubar that is hard to use without a mouse or keyboard.

The program does not need to backup or archive any data but the user can, if they want, open the save folder using the "Help->Open Save Folder" button in the menubar, which allows the user to backup or archive the data. In the future I may include a backup feature.

This program could be developed to use a more mobile-friendly UI using QtQuick, but this would require a complete re-write of the GUI code.
