# Success of The Solution

My program is fast to load, as it loaded in under 2 seconds on Windows XP with 128MB of RAM. The program runs without stuttering or lagging on even this old hardware. I would say that this means the program runs very well.

As in the feedback section, the stakeholders rated my solution 7/10 and 8/10 for ease of navigation.

My solution is truly cross-platform, running on Windows, MacOs and Linux:

Users can save, load, import and export circuits to be stored for revision or emailed to students for learning at home.
