# Success of The Solution

My program is fast to load, as it loaded in just under 2 seconds on Windows XP with 128**MB** of RAM. The program runs without stuttering or lagging on even very old hardware, so I would say that this means the program runs very well and meets the success critera.

As in the feedback section, the stakeholders rated my solution 7/10 and 8/10 for ease of navigation.

My solution is truly cross-platform, running on Windows, MacOs and Linux:
