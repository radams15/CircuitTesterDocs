# Future Development

In the future I could add many parts to my solution, and improve slightly on the actual layout and design of the code.

## Code improvement

I would like to split my backend into a proper, separate library that can be used by other programs. This would be beneficial as the library can be developed separately and used in multiple programs to port to different devices. As the only dependency of the analysis section is Eigen, which is compiled statically, that section can be compiled for any device that supports the C++14 standard.

## Program Improvements:

## Voltmeter and Ammeter

The voltmeter and ammeter should be added to the program as specified in the analysis.

They would simply derive from the Resistive Component, and simply just display either the voltage or the current at that point, rather than relying on just the displayed numbers over the whole circuit.

Other components that could be added are buzzers and bulbs, but bulbs would be more difficult as they are non-ohmic components so would need to take temperature into account.

## Load Box

The load box could be vastly improved, turning it from a confusing drop-down list into a grid of images that can be generated by the code, displaying the names of the circuits to the user, similar to the image below:

## Line Drawing

The algorithm that draws lines between components could be vasly improved, as currently the algorithm crosses lines and looks confusing.

This is because the algorithm now is drawing from the end of the first component to the start of the second component. 

This could be fixed by drawing lines between the two closest parts of the two components.

## Rotation of Components

I would also like to be able to rotate components, allowing the circuits to look more realistic, and making it look less confusing to users.

This would involve graphical updates, as well as an update to the save/load system to be able to store component orientation.

## Save Screen

This would be a simple addition that checks if the file name already exists, asking the user whether or not they want to override the file with a new save.
