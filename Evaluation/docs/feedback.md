# Stakeholder Feedback

As I had finished creating my project, I believed it was time to consult the stakeholders to get their final opinions on the finished product.

## Physics Teacher

I decided to ask my physics teacher a questionairre about the program.

- **On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being fastest), how fast would you say the program feels?**

10

- **How easy/hard would you say that the program is to understand and use?**

I found the program fairly easy to use after reading the tutorial, without the tutorial it was a little hard.

- **On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the easiest), how easy is the program to navigate and find required functions?**

7

- **Do you see yourself using this program to teach students the fundamentals of circuits as a replacement to physical circuits?**

Possibly, since it is free to use and has less parts than the alternatives. I only miss the ammeter and voltmeter components, as these would have been integral to the program.


## Physics Student


I decided to ask my peers a questionairre about the program.

- **On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being fastest), how fast would you say the program feels?**

9

- **How easy/hard would you say that the program is to understand and use?**

The program was slightly hard to understand, but after reading the tutorial it was easy.

- **On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the easiest), how easy is the program to navigate and find required functions?**

8

- **Do you see yourself using this program to learn about circuits for school**

Maybe, although it is very simplistic for what I need

## Reflection on the feedback

Overall, both the teacher and the student found my program was sufficiently fast for their use, although both concluded that the program is a little difficult to understand without any instruction. They did decide that the tutorial really helped them to figure out how the program worked.

The student wanted more components in the simulator, whereas the teacher was fairly happy with the selection of components.
