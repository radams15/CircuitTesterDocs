# Stakeholder Feedback

As I had finished creating my project, I believed it was time to consult the stakeholders to get their final opinions on the finished product.

I decided to ask my physics teacher a questionairre about the program.

- **On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being fastest), how fast would you say the program feels?**

9

- **How easy/hard would you say that the program is to understand and use?**

I find the program fairly easy to use after reading the tutorial.

- **On a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being the easiest), how easy is the program to navigate and find required functions?**

7

- **Do you see yourself using this program to teach students the fundamentals of circuits as a replacement to physical circuits?**

Possibly, since it is free to use and has less parts than the alternatives.
